# KSI-INR-02: Maintain a log of incidents and periodically review past incidents for patterns or vulnerabilities

## Overview

**Category:** Incident Reporting
**Status:** PASS
**Last Check:** 2025-09-23 03:05

**What it validates:** Maintain a log of incidents and periodically review past incidents for patterns or vulnerabilities

**Why it matters:** A hybrid validation model proves both that the underlying AWS infrastructure for incident response is correctly configured (EventBridge, CloudWatch, GuardDuty) and that the operational process is functioning, as evidenced by the artifacts it produces (incident database and review reports).

## Validation Method

1. `aws events list-rules --output json`
   *Verify EventBridge rules for incident automation*

2. `aws logs describe-log-groups --output json`
   *Verify CloudWatch log groups for incident logging*

3. `aws guardduty list-detectors --output json`
   *Verify GuardDuty is active for threat detection*

4. `aws securityhub get-findings --max-results 5 --output json`
   *Verify Security Hub for analysis capability*

5. **Manual Review:** Check for operational artifacts generated by the incident_automation.py script.

## Latest Results

WARNING Partial compliance: Infrastructure is configured, but operational artifacts are missing or incomplete. PASS Incident response infrastructure is well-configured (Score: 4/4).
- FAIL Operational log (incident_database.csv) is corrupt or unreadable.
- PASS Periodic review report found and appears valid.
