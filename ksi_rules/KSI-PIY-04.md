**Category:** Policy and Inventory
**Status:** PASS
**Last Check:** 2025-09-22 15:57

**What it validates:** Build security and privacy considerations into the Software Development Lifecycle and align with CISA Secure By Design principles

**Why it matters:** Validates secure development lifecycle through CodeBuild security testing, CodePipeline security gates, Lambda security automation, and enterprise development governance without container dependencies

## Validation Method

1. `aws codebuild list-projects --output json`
   *Check CodeBuild projects for security testing integration in SDLC*

2. `aws codepipeline list-pipelines --output json`
   *Validate CodePipeline for security gates and SDLC security integration*

3. `aws lambda list-functions --output json`
   *Check Lambda functions for security automation and SDLC integration*

4. `aws organizations describe-organization --output json`
   *Validate enterprise-wide development governance and security standards*

## Latest Results

PASS Advanced SDLC security automation (75%): PASS Security build integration: 3 security-focused CodeBuild projects
- PASS Security automation functions: 1 Lambda functions for SDLC security
- PASS Enterprise development governance: Organization-wide SDLC security standards available
