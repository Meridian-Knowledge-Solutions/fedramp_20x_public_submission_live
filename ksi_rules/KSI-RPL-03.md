**Status:** PASS
**Last Check:** 2025-09-23 13:26

**What it validates:** Perform system backups aligned with recovery objectives

**Why it matters:** Validates automated backup systems, retention policies, and backup job performance through AWS Backup service configuration and monitoring

## Validation Method

1. `aws backup list-backup-plans --output json`
   *Verify comprehensive backup plans are configured for system recovery*

2. `aws backup get-backup-plan --backup-plan-id $(aws backup list-backup-plans --query 'BackupPlansList[0].BackupPlanId' --output text 2>/dev/null || echo 'none') --output json 2>/dev/null || echo '{"BackupPlan":{}}'`
   *ADDED: Retrieve details of the primary backup plan to validate retention rules.*

3. `aws backup list-backup-jobs --by-state COMPLETED --max-results 50 --output json`
   *Check recent backup job completions and success rates*

4. `aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,BackupRetentionPeriod,DeletionProtection]' --output json`
   *Confirm RDS automated backup configuration and data protection settings*

5. `aws ec2 describe-snapshots --owner-ids self --output json`
   *Validate EBS snapshots for system backup coverage*
