# KSI-SVC-05: Continuously verify information resource integrity

## Overview

**Category:** Service Configuration
**Status:** PASS
**Last Check:** 2025-09-21 08:11

**What it validates:** Continuously verify information resource integrity

**Why it matters:** Validates comprehensive cryptographic integrity enforcement from basic audit trail validation to enterprise-grade multi-layer integrity protection, covering log validation, key management, code signing, database integrity, backup verification, and organizational integrity governance with automated monitoring and compliance

## Validation Method

1. `aws cloudtrail describe-trails --output json`
   *Check CloudTrail log file validation for audit trail integrity and tamper-evident logging*

2. `aws kms list-keys --output json`
   *Validate KMS keys available for cryptographic integrity protection and key-based verification*

3. `aws kms list-aliases --output json`
   *Check KMS key aliases and management for cryptographic key governance and integrity protection*

4. `aws s3api list-buckets --output json`
   *Analyze S3 bucket configurations for object integrity verification and versioning protection*

5. `aws rds describe-db-instances --output json`
   *Check RDS database instances for backup encryption and transaction log integrity protection*

6. `aws config describe-configuration-recorders --output json`
   *Validate AWS Config for configuration change integrity tracking and compliance monitoring*

7. `aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --output json`
   *Check CloudWatch alarms for integrity violation detection and automated response triggers*

8. `aws sns list-topics --output json`
   *Validate SNS topics for integrity event notification and stakeholder alerting workflows*

9. `aws backup list-backup-vaults --output json`
   *Check AWS Backup vaults for backup integrity verification and cryptographic protection*

10. `aws organizations describe-organization --output json`
   *Validate enterprise-wide integrity policies and organizational cryptographic governance standards across accounts*
