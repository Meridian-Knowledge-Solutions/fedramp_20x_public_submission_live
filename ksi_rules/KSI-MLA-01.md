# KSI-MLA-01: Operate a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or similar system(s) for centralized, tamper-resistant logging of events, activities, and changes

## Overview

**Category:** Monitoring, Logging, and Auditing
**Status:** FAIL
**Last Check:** 2025-09-21 03:05

**What it validates:** Operate a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or similar system(s) for centralized, tamper-resistant logging of events, activities, and changes

**Why it matters:** Validates comprehensive SIEM capabilities from basic centralized logging to enterprise-grade log management, analysis, and compliance

## Validation Method

1. `aws cloudtrail describe-trails --output json`
   *Check CloudTrail for centralized, tamper-resistant logging foundation*

2. `aws logs describe-log-groups --output json`
   *Validate centralized log collection and retention policies in CloudWatch*

3. `aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --output json`
   *Check automated log analysis and real-time alerting capabilities*

4. `aws kms list-keys --output json`
   *Validate cryptographic protection and encryption for sensitive logs*

5. `aws config describe-delivery-channels --output json`
   *Check compliance-grade log delivery and audit trail mechanisms*

6. `aws s3api list-buckets --output json`
   *Validate log archival, long-term storage, and forensic capabilities*

7. `aws securityhub get-findings --max-results 20 --output json`
   *Check advanced threat detection and security event correlation*

8. `aws organizations describe-organization --output json`
   *Validate enterprise-wide centralized logging and cross-account capabilities*

## Latest Results

FAIL Insufficient SIEM/centralized logging capabilities (6%): FAIL No CloudTrail found - required for centralized logging
- WARNING No CloudWatch log groups found
- INFO No CloudWatch alarms found for automated log analysis
- PASS Security Hub available: Ready for advanced SIEM capabilities
- INFO No Config delivery channels found for compliance log delivery
