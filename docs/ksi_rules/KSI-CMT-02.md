# KSI-CMT-02: Execute changes through redeployment of version controlled immutable resources rather than direct modification wherever possible

## Overview

**Category:** Change Management
**Status:** PASS
**Last Check:** 2025-09-11 02:38

**What it validates:** Execute changes through redeployment of version controlled immutable resources rather than direct modification wherever possible

**Why it matters:** Validates comprehensive immutable deployment capabilities from pilot to enterprise maturity levels through CloudFormation, Launch Templates, containers, serverless, and governance

## Validation Method

1. `aws cloudformation list-stacks --stack-status-filter CREATE_COMPLETE UPDATE_COMPLETE UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE --output json`
   *Check CloudFormation stacks for AWS-managed immutable infrastructure foundation*

2. `aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,LaunchTime,ImageId,InstanceType]' --output json`
   *Validate EC2 instances for immutable deployment patterns (Image-based vs direct modification)*

3. `aws ec2 describe-launch-templates --output json`
   *Check launch templates for standardized immutable instance deployment*

4. `aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-groups --output json`
   *Validate Auto Scaling Groups for immutable scaling and instance replacement patterns*

5. `aws ecs describe-services --output json`
   *Check containerized services for immutable container deployment and rolling update patterns*

6. `aws lambda list-functions --output json`
   *Validate serverless functions for immutable code deployment (function versioning)*

7. `aws codedeploy list-applications --output json`
   *Check CodeDeploy applications for automated immutable deployment workflows*

8. `aws ecr describe-repositories --output json`
   *Validate container registries for immutable container image management*

9. `aws servicecatalog search-products --output json`
   *Check Service Catalog for standardized immutable resource templates and governance*

10. `aws organizations describe-organization --output json`
   *Validate enterprise-wide immutable deployment policies and organizational governance standards*
