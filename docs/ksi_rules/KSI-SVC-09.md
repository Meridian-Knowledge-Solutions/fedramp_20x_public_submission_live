# KSI-SVC-09: Use mechanisms that continuously validate the authenticity and integrity of communications between information resources

## Overview

**Category:** Service Configuration
**Status:** PASS
**Last Check:** 2025-09-15 04:13

**What it validates:** Use mechanisms that continuously validate the authenticity and integrity of communications between information resources

**Why it matters:** Validates continuous communication integrity through comprehensive certificate management, encryption validation, inter-service security, and automated integrity checking covering ACM certificates, TLS configuration, VPC security, and cryptographic validation mechanisms

## Validation Method

1. `aws acm list-certificates --output json`
   *Validate TLS certificate management for communication authenticity and integrity*

2. `aws elbv2 describe-ssl-policies --output json`
   *Check SSL/TLS policies for secure communication configuration*

3. `aws elbv2 describe-listeners --output json`
   *Validate load balancer listeners for encrypted communication enforcement*

4. `aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoints --output json`
   *Check VPC endpoints for private and secure inter-service communication*

5. `aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[*].[DBInstanceIdentifier,StorageEncrypted]' --output json`
   *Validate database encryption for data communication integrity*

6. `aws kms list-keys --output json`
   *Check cryptographic infrastructure for communication integrity validation*

7. `aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --output json`
   *Validate continuous monitoring of certificate and communication integrity*

## Latest Results

PASS Advanced continuous communication integrity validation (80%): PASS Tls Certificate Management
- FAIL Continuous Certificate Monitoring
- PASS Inter Service Encryption
- PASS Integrity Validation Mechanisms
